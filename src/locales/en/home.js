        "Hazardous vapor transport from soil and groundwater sources into indoor spaces contaminates indoor air and threatens occupant health. RAVPI (Risk Assessment Program for Vapor Intrusion) is a risk calculation web application (https://rapvi-ku.web.app/) based on conceptual site models designed to assess the vapor intrusion risks. RAPVI was developed by the Environmental Hydrogeology Laboratory of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Korea University with the support of the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute.",

        "Risk Assessment means a systematic review and evaluation to predict the effects on human health or the environment when hazardous chemicals are exposed to humans and the environment. Risk Assessment consists of four steps: '1. Hazard Identification', '2. Dose-Response Assessment', '3. Exposure Assessment', and '4. Risk Determination'. '3. Exposure Assessment' and '4. Risk Determination' require concentrations and risk calculations based on exposure scenarios.",
      text3: "What is vapor intrusion?",
      text4:
        "Vapor intrusion is the process which contaminated vapors move from contaminated soil, groundwater, and other sources through the unsaturated zone, and ultimately into indoor spaces through cracks in building walls and floors, and pipes connected for the purpose of using groundwater. Vapor intrusion is the main pathway of risk assessment in urban environments.",
